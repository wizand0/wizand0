Hello! My name is Andrey Makarov 😊. I am an aspiring Android developer 📱, excited to dive into the world of app creation! I have a passion for traveling 🌍, as I love exploring new places and experiencing different cultures. Riding motorcycles 🏍️ is another one of my great loves; it gives me a sense of freedom and adventure.
